    <p class ="para">Child labour is the practice of having children engage in economic activity, on part or full-time basis. The practice deprives children of their childhood, and is harmful to their physical and mental development. Poverty, lack of good schools and growth of informal economy are considered as the important causes of child labour in India.</p>
    <p class="para">The 2001 national census of India estimated the total number of child labour, aged 5–14, to be at 12.6 million. The child labour problem is not unique to India; worldwide, about 217 million children work, many full-time. </p>
    <p class="para">In 2001, out of a 12.6 million, about 12 million children in India were in a hazardous job. UNICEF estimates that India with its larger population, has the highest number of labourers in the world under 14 years of age, while sub-saharan African countries have the highest percentage of children who are deployed as child labour. International Labour Organisation estimates that agriculture at 60 percent is the largest employer of child labour in India, while United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates 70% of child labour is deployed in agriculture and related activities. Outside of agriculture, child labour is observed in almost all informal sectors of the Indian economy. </p>

    <h2><u>Child labour laws in India</u></h2>
    <p class="section">Section 12 of India's Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986 requires prominent display of 'child labour is prohibited' signs in many industries and construction sites in local language and English. Above a sign at a construction site in Bangalore.</p>
    <p class="para">After its independence from colonial rule, India has passed a number of constitutional protections and laws on child labour.</p>
    <p class="para">The Constitution of India in the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy prohibits child labour below the age of 14 years in any factory or mine or castle or engaged in any other hazardous employment (Article 24). The constitution also envisioned that India shall, by 1960, provide infrastructure and resources for free and compulsory education to all children of the age six to 14 years. (Article 21-A and Article 45).</p>
    <p class="para">India has a federal form of government, and child labour is a matter on which both the central government and country governments can legislate, and have. The major national legislative developments include the following:</p>
    <p class="para"><b>The Factories Act of 1948:</b> The Act prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory. The law also placed rules on who, when and how long can pre-adults aged 15–18 years be employed in any factory.</p>
    <p class="para"><b>The Mines Act of 1952:</b> The Act prohibits the employment of children below 18 years of age in a mine.</p>
    <p class="para"><b>The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986: </b>The Act prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in hazardous occupations identified in a list by the law. The list was expanded in 2006, and again in 2008.</p>
    <p class="para"><b>The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act of 2000:</b>This law made it a crime, punishable with a prison term, for anyone to procure or employ a child in any hazardous employment or in bondage.</p>
    <p class="para"><b>The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009:</b>The law mandates free and compulsory education to all children aged 6 to 14 years. This legislation also mandated that 25 percent of seats in every private school must be allocated for children from disadvantaged groups and physically challenged children.</p>
    <p class="para">India formulated a National Policy on Child Labour in 1987. This Policy seeks to adopt a gradual & sequential approach with a focus on rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations. It envisioned strict enforcement of Indian laws on child labour combined with development programs to address the root causes of child labour such as poverty. In 1988, this led to the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) initiative. This legal and development initiative continues, with a current central government funding of 602 crores, targeted solely to eliminate child labour in India.Despite these efforts, child labour remains a major challenge for India.</p>
